# Markdown Example
Markdown allows you to easily include formatted text, images, and even formatted Dart code in your app.

## Styling

Style text as _italic_, __bold__, or `inline code` .

* Use bulleted lists
* To better clarify
* Your points

## Links

You can use [hyperlinks](hyperlink) in markdown

## Markdown widget

This is an example of how to create your own Markdown widget:
    new Markdown(data: 'Hello _world_!'); 

## Code blocks

Formatted Dart code looks really pretty too:

``` 
void main() {
  runApp(new MaterialApp(
    home: new Scaffold(
      body: new Markdown(data: markdownData)
    )
  ));
}
```

Enjoy!
